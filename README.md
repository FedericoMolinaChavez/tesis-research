Potyviridae virus is a plant related one. 30 different plant species are known for being affected by this type of virus. In this project clivage site automatic prediction from the virus is intended. For finding this clivage sites a machine learning aproximation will be used. The techniques chosen are, Convolutional neural networks and long short term memory. The methodology used will be experimental. For measuring the results, estatistical variables such as accuracy sensibility, specificity and Mathews correlation coeficient will be used.
